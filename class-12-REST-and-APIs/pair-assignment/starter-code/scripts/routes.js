// TODOne: Configure routes for this app with page.js, by registering each URL your app can handle,
// linked to a a single controller function to handle it:
page('/', articlesController.index);
page('/about', aboutController.index);

// TODOne: What function do you call to activate page.js? Fire it off now, to execute
page();


// DONE: Both of the above were marked as TODO but were done for us.
